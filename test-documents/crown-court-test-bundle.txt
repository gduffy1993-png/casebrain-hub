WITNESS STATEMENTS
------------------

WITNESS 1: SARAH MITCHELL (Complainant)
Statement Date: 14/11/2023
Statement Time: 20:30
Officer: PC David Thompson (Badge 4521)

"I was walking along Market Street at about quarter to eight in the evening. 
I had just finished work and was heading to the bus stop to go home. I was 
carrying my handbag over my right shoulder. It's a black leather handbag, 
quite large, with a long strap.

As I approached the junction with Back Lane, I felt someone grab my left arm 
very forcefully from behind. I was pulled backwards and lost my balance. A 
male voice said 'Give me the bag, don't make this difficult.' I tried to hold 
onto my bag but the person was much stronger than me. They yanked it off my 
shoulder and I fell to the ground.

I landed on my hands and knees. I was in shock and scared. The person ran 
away very quickly towards Back Lane. I didn't get a good look at their face 
because it happened so fast and it was quite dark, but I could see they were 
wearing a dark hooded top and dark trousers. They were about average height, 
maybe 5'10" or so, and seemed to be a white male.

My handbag contained my wallet with about £450 in cash (I'd just been to 
the bank), my iPhone 14 Pro mobile phone, my driving licence, some credit 
cards, and my house keys. The phone was quite new, I'd only had it a few 
months.

I called the police straight away from a shop nearby. My arm really hurt 
where I'd been grabbed, and my hands were bleeding from where I'd fallen. 
I was very shaken up and upset. I've never experienced anything like this 
before."

WITNESS 2: MICHAEL CHEN (Independent Witness)
Statement Date: 14/11/2023
Statement Time: 20:45
Officer: PC Emma Wilson (Badge 3892)

"I was walking along Market Street on my way home from work. I work as a 
chef at the restaurant on the corner. It was about 7:45pm, maybe a bit later. 
The street was reasonably well-lit but it was dark outside.

I saw a woman walking ahead of me, maybe 20 or 30 metres away. She was 
carrying a handbag. Then I saw someone come up behind her very quickly. 
This person grabbed her and there was a struggle. The woman fell down and 
the person ran off with what looked like her handbag.

I couldn't see the person's face clearly because they had a hood up, but 
they were wearing dark clothing - a dark hoodie and dark trousers or jeans. 
They ran off down Back Lane, which is a side street. I'd say they were 
average height, maybe 5'9" to 5'11", and appeared to be male.

I went over to help the woman. She was on the ground and seemed quite 
distressed. She was asking me to call the police, which I did. I stayed 
with her until the police arrived about 5 or 10 minutes later.

I didn't see the incident start, only from when the person grabbed her. 
It all happened very quickly, maybe 10 or 15 seconds from start to finish."

WITNESS 3: PC DAVID THOMPSON (Attending Officer)
Statement Date: 15/11/2023
Statement Time: 09:00
Officer: DS James Morrison (Badge 2103)

"On 14th November 2023, I was on duty with PC Emma Wilson. At approximately 
19:47 hours, we received a call to attend Market Street, Manchester, following 
a report of a robbery.

We arrived at the scene at 19:55 hours. The complainant, Sarah Mitchell, was 
present and appeared distressed. She had visible injuries to her hands and 
arms. She was able to provide a clear account of what had happened.

I observed the scene. Market Street is a busy pedestrianised area with good 
lighting and CCTV coverage. There were no obvious signs of a struggle at the 
location described by the complainant, but this is not unusual given the high 
footfall in the area.

I took an initial statement from Sarah Mitchell and arranged for her to be 
transported to hospital for medical examination. I also spoke to a witness, 
Michael Chen, who provided a statement.

The following day, I reviewed CCTV footage from cameras in the area. The 
footage showed an individual matching the description provided by witnesses, 
loitering in the area prior to the incident and running away immediately 
afterwards. The footage was of sufficient quality to identify the individual 
as James Patterson, who was known to police.

A search of police records showed that James Patterson had previous 
convictions for theft in 2019 and common assault in 2021. He was subject 
to a community order at the time of this offence."
