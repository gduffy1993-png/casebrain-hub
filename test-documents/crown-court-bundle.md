## WITNESS STATEMENTS

### WITNESS 1: SARAH MITCHELL (Complainant)

**Statement Date:** 14/11/2023  
**Statement Time:** 20:30  
**Officer:** PC David Thompson (Badge 4521)  
**Witness Type:** Complainant/Victim

> "I was walking along Market Street at about quarter to eight in the evening. I had just finished work and was heading to the bus stop to go home. I was carrying my handbag over my right shoulder. It's a black leather handbag, quite large, with a long strap.
>
> As I approached the junction with Back Lane, I felt someone grab my left arm very forcefully from behind. I was pulled backwards and lost my balance. A male voice said 'You're going to pay for what you did' and then I felt something hard hit the side of my face. It was extremely painful.
>
> I fell to the ground and the person continued to hit me. I could see they were holding something metallic, maybe a metal bar or pipe. They struck me several times - on my face, my arms, and my body. I was trying to protect myself but I couldn't. The person was much stronger than me.
>
> I remember screaming and trying to get away. The person said something like 'This is what happens' but I was in so much pain and shock I can't remember exactly. They hit me at least four or five times before running away.
>
> I didn't get a good look at their face because it happened so fast and it was quite dark, but I could see they were wearing a dark hooded top and dark trousers. They were about average height, maybe 5'10" or so, and seemed to be a white male. I'm fairly certain it was a man based on the voice and strength.
>
> I called the police straight away from a shop nearby. My face was bleeding badly and I couldn't see properly out of my left eye. My whole body hurt. I was terrified and in a lot of pain. I've never experienced anything like this before.
>
> I don't know why this happened to me. I don't recall having any interaction with this person before the attack. It seemed completely unprovoked from my perspective."

### WITNESS 2: MICHAEL CHEN (Independent Witness)

**Statement Date:** 14/11/2023  
**Statement Time:** 20:45  
**Officer:** PC Emma Wilson (Badge 3892)  
**Witness Type:** Independent Civilian Witness

> "I was walking along Market Street on my way home from work. I work as a chef at the restaurant on the corner. It was about 7:45pm, maybe a bit later. The street was reasonably well-lit but it was dark outside.
>
> I saw a woman walking ahead of me, maybe 20 or 30 metres away. She was carrying a handbag. Then I saw someone come up behind her very quickly. This person grabbed her and there was a struggle. I could see the person was holding something - it looked like a metal bar or pipe, maybe 30 or 40 centimetres long.
>
> The person hit the woman several times. I could hear the impacts and the woman screaming. It was very violent. The person struck her on the head and body multiple times. The woman fell to the ground and the person continued to hit her while she was down.
>
> I couldn't see the person's face clearly because they had a hood up, but they were wearing dark clothing - a dark hoodie and dark trousers or jeans. They were average height, maybe 5'9" to 5'11", and appeared to be male. The whole thing lasted maybe 30 seconds, then the person ran off down Back Lane.
>
> I went over to help the woman. She was on the ground and there was blood on her face. She seemed very distressed and in a lot of pain. She was asking me to call the police, which I did immediately. I stayed with her until the police arrived about 5 or 10 minutes later.
>
> I was shocked by what I saw. It was a very brutal attack. The person seemed to be deliberately trying to hurt her, not just rob her."

### WITNESS 3: PC DAVID THOMPSON (Attending Officer)

**Statement Date:** 15/11/2023  
**Statement Time:** 09:00  
**Officer:** DS James Morrison (Badge 2103)  
**Witness Type:** Police Officer

> "On 14th November 2023, I was on duty with PC Emma Wilson. At approximately 19:47 hours, we received a call to attend Market Street, Manchester, following a report of a serious assault.
>
> We arrived at the scene at 19:55 hours. The complainant, Sarah Mitchell, was present and appeared to be in significant distress. She had visible injuries to her face, which was bleeding. Her left eye was swollen and she appeared to have difficulty seeing. She had visible bruising and injuries to her arms and body.
>
> I observed the scene. Market Street is a busy pedestrianised area with good lighting and CCTV coverage. There were bloodstains on the pavement at the location described by the complainant, consistent with her account.
>
> I took an initial statement from Sarah Mitchell. She was able to provide a clear account despite being clearly shaken and in pain. She described being attacked from behind by a male who struck her multiple times with what she believed was a metal implement.
>
> I also spoke to a witness, Michael Chen, who provided a statement confirming he had observed the attack and saw the assailant striking the complainant multiple times with a metal object.
>
> I arranged for Sarah Mitchell to be transported to hospital immediately for medical examination, as her injuries appeared serious.
>
> The following day, I reviewed CCTV footage from cameras in the area. The footage showed an individual matching the description provided by witnesses, loitering in the area prior to the incident and running away immediately afterwards. The footage was of sufficient quality to identify the individual as James Patterson, who was known to police.
>
> A search of police records showed that James Patterson had previous convictions for violence, including a conviction for ABH in 2021. He was subject to a community order at the time of this offence.
>
> Given the serious nature of the injuries and the apparent use of a weapon, the case was treated as a section 18 offence (wounding with intent to cause GBH) rather than a section 47 (ABH) or section 20 (unlawful wounding)."

All injuries are consistent with the account provided by the complainant. The nature and severity of the injuries, particularly the fractured cheekbone and multiple impact sites, are consistent with a sustained and deliberate attack using a hard object. The injuries are not consistent with a single accidental fall or minor altercation.

The injuries required significant medical intervention and will likely result in permanent scarring. The psychological impact is also significant and ongoing.

## PROSECUTION CASE SUMMARY

The prosecution case is that on 14th November 2023, James Patterson unlawfully and maliciously wounded Sarah Mitchell with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

### PROSECUTION EVIDENCE:

1. **Identification Evidence:**
   - CCTV footage clearly shows defendant at the scene at the time of the offence
   - Facial recognition software identified defendant with 92% confidence
   - Both complainant and independent witness identified defendant from CCTV stills

2. **Witness Evidence:**
   - Complainant provides clear and consistent account of being attacked with a metal implement
   - Independent witness (Michael Chen) corroborates the account and observed the attack
   - Attending officer (PC Thompson) provides evidence of injuries and scene

3. **Medical Evidence:**
   - Serious injuries including fractured cheekbone requiring surgery
   - Multiple impact sites consistent with sustained attack
   - Injuries consistent with being struck with hard object (metal pipe)
   - Permanent scarring and ongoing psychological impact

4. **Forensic Evidence:**
   - Defendant's fingerprints found on metal pipe recovered from scene
   - Pipe consistent with weapon described by witnesses
   - Blood at scene matches complainant

5. **Defendant's Conduct:**
   - Defendant provided "no comment" interview, failing to provide any account or alibi
   - Defendant has previous convictions for violence (ABH in 2021)
   - Defendant was in breach of community order at time of offence

### PROSECUTION SUBMISSION:

The prosecution case is strong. There is clear identification evidence placing the defendant at the scene at the time of the offence. The injuries are serious and consistent with an attack using a weapon. The defendant's fingerprints on the weapon provide strong forensic evidence. The defendant's failure to provide any account, combined with his previous convictions for violence, supports the prosecution case that this was a deliberate and intentional attack with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

The prosecution will invite the jury to convict the defendant of the section 18 offence.
