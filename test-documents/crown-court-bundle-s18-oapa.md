## WITNESS STATEMENT: MARCUS JOHNSON (COMPLAINANT)

**Statement Date:** 25 November 2023  
**Taken By:** DC Emma Thompson  
**Witness DOB:** 8 July 1995  
**Address:** 12 Oakwood Drive, Headingley, Leeds, LS6 3HJ  
**Occupation:** Retail Assistant

**Statement:**

My name is Marcus Johnson. I am 28 years old and I work as a retail assistant at a shop in the city centre. On the evening of 23 November 2023, I went to the Golden Dragon Takeaway on Kirkstall Road with my friends Liam and Ryan. We got there at about half past ten, maybe a bit later. We ordered some food and waited for it to be ready.

We were eating inside the takeaway when this bloke came in. I didn't really pay much attention to him at first. He was talking to the staff, seemed a bit annoyed about something. I think he left and came back in later. I'm not sure of the exact times, it all happened quite fast.

I went to the toilet at the back of the takeaway. When I came back, my friends were getting ready to leave. As I was walking towards the door, this bloke came back in. He was the same one from before. He started saying something to me, I can't remember exactly what. I think he said something about me looking at him or something. I told him to calm down, I wasn't looking for any trouble.

He got really aggressive then. He was swearing and getting in my face. I tried to back away but he followed me. Then he pulled out a knife. I saw it clearly, it was a kitchen knife, looked quite big. I panicked and tried to get away but he lunged at me and stabbed me in the stomach.

I felt this sharp pain and I fell to the floor. I could feel blood. It was really scary. People were helping me, putting pressure on the wound. Someone called an ambulance. The bloke ran off straight away.

I was taken to hospital in an ambulance. I had to have surgery. The doctors said it was serious. I was in hospital for about a week.

I don't know the bloke's name. I've never seen him before that night. But I would recognise him if I saw him again. He was white, about 5 foot 10 or 11, medium build, dark hair, wearing a dark hooded top. He looked like he was in his early thirties.

When the police showed me some photos later, I picked out Daniel Hughes. I'm sure it was him. I'm certain it was the same person who stabbed me.

I want to make a complaint about this. I didn't do anything to provoke him. I was just trying to leave the takeaway and he attacked me for no reason.

**Signed:** Marcus Johnson  
**Date:** 25 November 2023

**Addendum Statement - 5 December 2023:**

After I made my first statement, I've had more time to think about what happened. I want to add that I'm now even more certain it was Daniel Hughes. I've seen his photo in the papers and I'm 100% sure it's him. The way he moved, his build, everything matches.

Also, I remember now that before he stabbed me, he said something like "you think you're hard, do you?" or words to that effect. I think he might have mistaken me for someone else, or he was just looking for a fight.

I stand by everything in my first statement. I'm telling the truth about what happened.

**Signed:** Marcus Johnson  
**Date:** 5 December 2023

## WITNESS STATEMENT: WEI CHEN (STAFF MEMBER)

**Statement Date:** 24 November 2023  
**Taken By:** PC David Roberts  
**Witness DOB:** 12 May 1987  
**Address:** 34 Chapel Allerton Road, Leeds, LS7 4PD  
**Occupation:** Takeaway Staff Member

**Statement:**

My name is Wei Chen. I work at the Golden Dragon Takeaway on Kirkstall Road. I was working on the evening of 23 November 2023. I was serving customers behind the counter.

At around 11:20pm, a man came into the takeaway. He was complaining about an order from earlier. I don't remember exactly what he said, but he seemed angry. I tried to help him but he wasn't satisfied. He left the shop but I could see him outside through the window. He was on his phone.

A bit later, maybe 15 or 20 minutes, some customers who had been eating inside were getting ready to leave. There were three young men, I think. One of them went to the toilet. When he came back, the angry man came back into the shop.

The angry man started shouting at the customer. I couldn't hear exactly what was being said, but it was clear there was an argument. The customer tried to walk away but the angry man blocked him. Then I saw the angry man pull out a knife. It happened very quickly.

The angry man stabbed the customer in the stomach. The customer fell down. There was blood. I was shocked. I called 999 immediately. The angry man ran out of the shop straight away.

The customer was bleeding a lot. Other customers helped him. The ambulance came quite quickly, maybe 5 minutes. The police came too.

I didn't know either of these men. I had never seen the angry man before. I don't know his name. I would describe him as white, medium height, dark hair, wearing dark clothes with a hood. I couldn't see his face very clearly because of the hood.

I'm not sure I could identify him again. It all happened so fast and I was focused on calling for help. But I'm certain he had a knife and he stabbed the customer.

**Signed:** Wei Chen  
**Date:** 24 November 2023

## WITNESS STATEMENT: LIAM PARKER (INDEPENDENT WITNESS)

**Statement Date:** 24 November 2023  
**Taken By:** PC Lisa Morgan  
**Witness DOB:** 3 September 1996  
**Address:** 8 Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9AX  
**Occupation:** Student

**Statement:**

My name is Liam Parker. I'm 27 years old and I'm a student at Leeds University. On 23 November 2023, I was with my friends Marcus Johnson and Ryan Mitchell at the Golden Dragon Takeaway on Kirkstall Road.

We got there around 10:30pm and ordered food. We were eating inside. I noticed a man come in at some point, he was talking to the staff. He seemed annoyed about something. He left but I saw him outside through the window.

Later, Marcus went to the toilet. When he came back, we were getting ready to leave. As Marcus was walking towards the door, the same man came back in. He started saying something to Marcus. I couldn't hear exactly what, but it sounded aggressive.

Marcus tried to walk away but the man blocked him. Then the man pulled out a knife. I saw it clearly - it was a kitchen knife, quite large. Marcus tried to back away but the man lunged forward and stabbed Marcus in the stomach.

Marcus fell to the floor. There was blood everywhere. The man ran out immediately. I went to help Marcus, along with other people. Someone called an ambulance.

I don't know the man who did it. I had never seen him before. He was white, medium build, wearing a dark hooded top. I couldn't see his face properly because of the hood, but I would say he was in his late twenties or early thirties.

I'm not sure I could pick him out from photos. It was dark, it happened fast, and I was focused on helping Marcus. But I'm certain about what I saw - he had a knife and he stabbed Marcus.

**Signed:** Liam Parker  
**Date:** 24 November 2023

## WITNESS STATEMENT: RYAN MITCHELL (INDEPENDENT WITNESS)

**Statement Date:** 24 November 2023  
**Taken By:** PC Lisa Morgan  
**Witness DOB:** 19 November 1994  
**Address:** 15 Burley Road, Leeds, LS4 1PQ  
**Occupation:** Bar Worker

**Statement:**

I'm Ryan Mitchell, 29 years old. I work in a bar in the city centre. On 23 November 2023, I was with Marcus Johnson and Liam Parker at the Golden Dragon Takeaway.

We arrived around 10:30pm, maybe a bit later. We ordered food and ate inside. I remember a man coming in and talking to the staff. He seemed agitated. He left but I saw him outside.

Marcus went to the toilet. When he came back, we were about to leave. The man came back in and approached Marcus. There was an argument. I think the man said something like "what are you looking at?" or similar. Marcus told him to calm down.

The man got really aggressive. He was swearing and getting close to Marcus. Marcus tried to back away. Then the man pulled out a knife - I think it was a kitchen knife. Marcus panicked and tried to get away, but the man stabbed him in the side, or maybe the stomach. I'm not 100% sure exactly where.

Marcus collapsed. The man ran off straight away. I helped apply pressure to the wound while someone called an ambulance.

I don't know who the man was. I had never seen him before. He was white, medium height, dark hair, wearing a dark hooded top. I couldn't see his face clearly.

I'm not confident I could identify him. It was dark, it happened quickly, and I was worried about Marcus. But I'm certain he had a knife and he stabbed Marcus.

**Signed:** Ryan Mitchell  
**Date:** 24 November 2023

**Note:** There is a discrepancy between Ryan Mitchell's statement (stabbed in "side") and Marcus Johnson's statement (stabbed in "stomach/abdomen"). Medical evidence confirms injury to lower left abdomen.

## WITNESS STATEMENT: DAVID ROBERTS (ARRESTING OFFICER)

**Statement Date:** 25 November 2023  
**Taken By:** DC Emma Thompson  
**Officer Number:** 4521  
**Rank:** Police Constable  
**Station:** Elland Road Police Station

**Statement:**

I am PC David Roberts, badge number 4521, based at Elland Road Police Station. On 23 November 2023, I was on mobile patrol with PC Lisa Morgan when we received a call at 23:42 hours to attend the Golden Dragon Takeaway, 89 Kirkstall Road, Leeds, following reports of a stabbing.

We arrived at the scene at 23:44 hours. The takeaway was cordoned off by members of the public. Inside, I observed a male, later identified as Marcus Johnson, lying on the floor with what appeared to be a stab wound to his abdomen. Members of the public were applying pressure to the wound. There was a significant amount of blood on the floor.

I immediately requested ambulance attendance, which was already en route. I began preserving the scene and took initial witness details from staff member Wei Chen and customers Liam Parker and Ryan Mitchell.

Wei Chen informed me that the suspect had run from the scene in the direction of Kirkstall Road. I broadcast a description: white male, medium build, dark hooded top, last seen running towards Kirkstall Road.

PC Morgan and I remained at the scene until the arrival of CID officers. The scene was handed over to DC Emma Thompson at approximately 00:30 hours on 24 November 2023.

On 24 November 2023, at 16:00 hours, I was instructed to attend 47 Mill Lane, Beeston, Leeds, to assist with the arrest of Daniel Hughes in connection with this incident. I arrived at 16:10 hours along with other officers.

DC Thompson knocked on the door and it was answered by a female, later identified as Patricia Hughes, the defendant's mother. She confirmed that Daniel Hughes was present in the property.

We entered the property and located Daniel Hughes in the living room. DC Thompson informed him that he was under arrest on suspicion of section 18 Offences Against the Person Act 1861, wounding with intent. I cautioned him: "You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence."

Hughes made no reply to the caution. He was compliant and did not resist arrest. He was handcuffed and transported to Elland Road Police Station, arriving at 16:45 hours.

I was not involved in the subsequent interview or charging process.

## WITNESS STATEMENT: EMMA THOMPSON (OFFICER IN CHARGE)

**Statement Date:** 10 December 2023  
**Taken By:** DS Michael Brown  
**Officer Number:** 3287  
**Rank:** Detective Constable  
**Station:** Homicide & Major Enquiry Team, West Yorkshire Police

**Statement:**

I am DC Emma Thompson, badge number 3287, based at the Homicide & Major Enquiry Team. I was appointed Officer in Charge (OIC) of this investigation on 24 November 2023.

**Initial Investigation:**

On 24 November 2023, at 08:00 hours, I attended Leeds General Infirmary to speak with the complainant Marcus Johnson. He was in the intensive care unit following emergency surgery. He was conscious and able to speak, though clearly in pain and distress.

Johnson provided an initial account. He stated that he had been stabbed by a man he did not know, at the Golden Dragon Takeaway on Kirkstall Road. He described the suspect as a white male, medium height, dark hair, wearing a dark hooded top. He stated he had never seen the man before and did not know his name, but thought he might be called "Dan" or "Daniel" based on something he heard during the incident, though he was not certain.

Johnson stated that the man had entered the takeaway, become aggressive, and stabbed him with a kitchen knife. He was unable to provide further detail due to his condition.

**CCTV Evidence:**

At 09:30 hours on 24 November 2023, I attended the Golden Dragon Takeaway and obtained CCTV footage from the premises. The system had cameras covering the interior and exterior of the shop. However, the footage quality was poor. The interior camera was positioned high on the wall and the images were grainy, particularly in low light conditions.

I reviewed the footage. It shows:
- A male entering the takeaway at approximately 23:20 hours, speaking to staff, then leaving
- The same male returning at approximately 23:37 hours
- An altercation occurring, though the exact details are difficult to discern due to poor image quality
- A male stabbing another male, though the weapon is not clearly visible
- The suspect leaving immediately after the stabbing

The footage does not provide a clear view of the suspect's face. He is wearing a hooded top which obscures his features. The footage is of limited value for identification purposes, though it does confirm the sequence of events described by witnesses.

**Arrest and Interview:**

On 24 November 2023, following intelligence checks, Daniel Hughes was identified as a potential suspect. Hughes is known to police and has previous convictions for violence. He was located at his home address, 47 Mill Lane, Beeston, Leeds.

At 16:15 hours, I attended the address with other officers and arrested Hughes on suspicion of section 18 OAPA 1861. He was cautioned and transported to Elland Road Police Station.

Hughes was interviewed under caution on 24 November 2023 at 18:30 hours. The interview was conducted in the presence of an appropriate adult (his mother, Patricia Hughes) and his solicitor, Mr. James Wilson of Wilson & Co Solicitors.

Hughes was asked questions about his whereabouts on 23 November 2023, his knowledge of the Golden Dragon Takeaway, and his involvement in the incident. He exercised his right to silence throughout, answering "no comment" to all questions.

The interview concluded at 20:00 hours. Hughes was charged with section 18 OAPA 1861 at 20:30 hours. He made no reply to the charge.

**Disclosure:**

I have been responsible for disclosure in this case. Initial disclosure was served on 20 December 2023. This included witness statements, CCTV footage, medical records, and custody records.

Further disclosure has been requested by the defence on multiple occasions. Some items remain outstanding, including:
- Full custody record (some entries are illegible)
- Complete CCTV footage from surrounding premises (some cameras were not working)
- Forensic analysis of clothing seized from the defendant (analysis incomplete)
- Phone data from the defendant's mobile phone (awaiting extraction)
- Intelligence reports relating to the defendant (some redacted sections under review)

I am continuing to pursue these items and will serve them as soon as they become available.

   - Hooded top obscures facial features
   - Poor image quality makes identification difficult
   - No clear view of suspect's face from any angle

   - Timing of weapon production is not clear

4. **Technical Issues:**

   - Some cameras were not recording at optimal settings
   - No audio recording available
   - Time stamps may have slight discrepancies (estimated +/- 2 minutes)

5. **Missing Footage:**
   - No CCTV obtained from surrounding premises (some cameras not working, others refused access)
   - No body-worn video from attending officers (officers arrived after suspect had left)
   - No dashcam footage from passing vehicles

**DEFENCE POSITION ON CCTV:**

The defence will contend that the CCTV footage is of such poor quality that it cannot safely be used for identification purposes. The suspect's face is not visible, and the general description (white male, medium build, dark hooded top) could apply to many individuals. The footage does not provide sufficient detail to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is the person shown.

## FORENSIC EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### KNIFE - NOT RECOVERED

Despite extensive searches, the weapon used in the offence has not been recovered. Searches were conducted at:
- The scene (Golden Dragon Takeaway and surrounding area)
- The defendant's home address
- Areas between the scene and defendant's address
- Local waste bins and disposal sites

No knife matching the description provided by witnesses has been found. This significantly limits the forensic evidence available.

### DNA EVIDENCE

**Swabs from Scene:**
- Blood samples from floor of takeaway - confirmed as belonging to Marcus Johnson
- No other DNA profiles identified from scene

**Swabs from Defendant:**
- Clothing seized from defendant's home address on 24 November 2023
- Dark hooded top, jeans, trainers
- No blood or DNA evidence linking defendant to scene
- No DNA from Marcus Johnson found on defendant's clothing

**Swabs from Complainant:**
- Clothing worn by Marcus Johnson at time of incident
- No DNA from defendant found on complainant's clothing

**DNA Analysis Summary:**
Forensic analysis has failed to establish any DNA link between the defendant and the scene, or between the defendant and the complainant. This is not necessarily exculpatory, as the defendant may have changed clothing, or DNA transfer may not have occurred.

### FINGERPRINT EVIDENCE

**Scene Examination:**
- Fingerprints lifted from various surfaces in takeaway
- None match the defendant's fingerprints (defendant's prints on file from previous convictions)
- Some prints unidentified (likely belonging to staff or other customers)

**Defendant's Fingerprints:**
- Defendant's fingerprints are on file
- No match to any prints found at scene

### CLOTHING ANALYSIS

**Defendant's Clothing (Seized 24 November 2023):**
- Dark blue hooded top (Nike brand)
- Dark blue jeans (Levi's)
- Black trainers (Adidas)
- All items examined for blood, fibres, or other trace evidence
- Results: No blood detected. No fibres matching complainant's clothing. No other significant findings.

**Complainant's Clothing:**
- White t-shirt (blood-stained)
- Blue jeans (blood-stained)
- Analysis: Blood confirmed as complainant's own. No foreign fibres or DNA detected.

### MOBILE PHONE ANALYSIS

**Defendant's Mobile Phone:**
- Seized on 24 November 2023
- Analysis incomplete - awaiting full extraction
- Initial review shows phone was in use around time of incident (calls/texts)
- Location data analysis pending
- Full call logs and message history extraction in progress

**Note:** Defence has requested full disclosure of phone analysis. This remains outstanding.

### FORENSIC EVIDENCE WEAKNESSES

1. **No weapon recovered** - Cannot link weapon to defendant or establish ownership
2. **No DNA link** - No forensic connection between defendant and scene/complainant
3. **No fingerprint link** - Defendant's prints not found at scene
4. **No clothing evidence** - No blood or fibres linking defendant to incident
5. **Limited scene evidence** - Scene was busy public area, contamination likely
6. **Time delay** - Defendant arrested approximately 17 hours after incident, opportunity to dispose of evidence

**DEFENCE POSITION ON FORENSIC EVIDENCE:**

The defence will contend that the complete absence of forensic evidence linking the defendant to the scene or the complainant is highly significant. In a case where the defendant is alleged to have stabbed the complainant, one would expect to find:
- Blood on the defendant's clothing
- DNA transfer between defendant and complainant
- Fingerprints at the scene
- Recovery of the weapon

The absence of all of these factors raises serious questions about the identification evidence and the prosecution case as a whole.

---

## PACE COMPLIANCE OVERVIEW

### CODE C - DETENTION, TREATMENT AND QUESTIONING

**Compliance Issues:**

1. **Appropriate Adult Delay:**
   - Defendant arrived at custody at 16:45 hours
   - Appropriate adult (mother) did not arrive until approximately 18:00 hours
   - Interview did not commence until 18:30 hours
   - Delay of approximately 1.5 hours may constitute a breach of PACE Code C
   - Defence position: Defendant should not have been interviewed without appropriate adult present, and the delay may have caused distress

2. **Custody Record Completeness:**
   - Some entries in custody record are illegible
   - Missing cell check entry at 02:30 hours
   - Incomplete medical assessment
   - May constitute breach of Code C requirement to maintain accurate records

3. **Review of Detention:**
   - Reviews appear to have been conducted appropriately
   - No obvious breaches identified

### CODE D - IDENTIFICATION

**Identification Procedures:**

1. **VIPER Procedure:**
   - No VIPER identification procedure conducted
   - Complainant identified defendant from photographs shown by police
   - This was an informal identification, not a formal Code D procedure
   - Defence position: This is a significant breach. A formal identification procedure should have been conducted, particularly given the poor quality of CCTV and the fact that the complainant did not know the defendant

2. **Photograph Identification:**
   - Complainant was shown photographs by police officers
   - Procedure not conducted in accordance with Code D
   - No independent officer present
   - No record of procedure maintained
   - Defence position: This is highly prejudicial and may render the identification evidence inadmissible

3. **CCTV Identification:**
   - CCTV footage shown to witnesses
   - No formal procedure followed
   - Defence position: Witnesses may have been influenced by seeing footage before making statements

**DEFENCE POSITION ON PACE COMPLIANCE:**

The defence will contend that there have been significant breaches of PACE Codes C and D, which may render evidence inadmissible under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. In particular:

1. The identification procedure was fundamentally flawed and highly prejudicial
2. The delay in providing an appropriate adult may have affected the fairness of the investigation
3. Incomplete custody records raise questions about the reliability of the investigation

The defence will seek to exclude identification evidence and may seek a stay of proceedings if breaches are sufficiently serious.

## DEFENCE STATEMENT

**Date Served:** 8 February 2024  
**Defendant:** Daniel James Hughes  
**Solicitor:** Sarah Mitchell, Mitchell & Partners Solicitors  
**Case Number:** T2024/01247

**DEFENCE CASE:**

The defendant denies the offence. He was not at the Golden Dragon Takeaway on 23 November 2023 and was not involved in any incident with Marcus Johnson. He did not stab Marcus Johnson or anyone else.

**DEFENCE TO CHARGE:**

The defendant will contend that:

1. **Mistaken Identification:**
   - The identification evidence is unreliable and should be excluded
   - The identification procedure was fundamentally flawed (breach of PACE Code D)
   - The complainant did not know the defendant and made identification from poor quality photographs
   - CCTV footage is of such poor quality that it cannot safely be used for identification
   - Witness descriptions are generic and could apply to many individuals
   - There is no forensic evidence linking the defendant to the scene

2. **Alibi:**
   - The defendant will provide evidence of his whereabouts on 23 November 2023
   - He was at home with his mother, Patricia Hughes, at the material time
   - He did not leave the house on the evening of 23 November 2023
   - His mother will give evidence to this effect

3. **Disclosure Failures:**
   - Significant disclosure failures have occurred
   - Key material remains outstanding, including complete custody record, mobile phone analysis, and CCTV from surrounding premises
   - These failures prejudice the defence and may render a fair trial impossible

4. **PACE Breaches:**
   - Significant breaches of PACE Codes C and D have occurred
   - Identification procedure was fundamentally flawed
   - Delay in providing appropriate adult
   - Incomplete custody records
   - These breaches may render evidence inadmissible

5. **Forensic Evidence:**
   - Complete absence of forensic evidence linking defendant to scene or complainant
   - No DNA, fingerprints, or clothing evidence
   - No weapon recovered
   - This absence of evidence is highly significant

6. **Prosecution Weaknesses:**
   - Inconsistencies in witness accounts
   - Poor quality CCTV
   - No weapon recovered
   - No forensic link
   - Flawed identification procedure
   - Disclosure failures

**ISSUES FOR TRIAL:**

1. Identification - reliability and admissibility
2. Alibi evidence
3. Disclosure failures
4. PACE compliance
5. Forensic evidence (absence of)
6. Witness credibility and consistency

**DEFENDANT'S POSITION:**

The defendant maintains his innocence. He was not involved in this incident. The prosecution case is based on unreliable identification evidence, supported by poor quality CCTV and inconsistent witness accounts. There is no forensic evidence linking him to the scene. The case against him is weak and should not proceed, or if it does proceed, he should be acquitted.

**Signed:** Sarah Mitchell  
**Date:** 8 February 2024

## PROSECUTION WEAKNESSES

1. **Identification Evidence:**
   - Flawed identification procedure (breach of PACE Code D)
   - Complainant did not know defendant
   - Identification from photographs, not formal procedure
   - CCTV of poor quality, face not visible
   - Generic witness descriptions
   - No forensic link

2. **Forensic Evidence:**
   - Complete absence of forensic evidence linking defendant to scene
   - No DNA, fingerprints, or clothing evidence
   - No weapon recovered
   - No blood on defendant's clothing
   - No DNA transfer between defendant and complainant

3. **CCTV Evidence:**
   - Poor quality footage
   - Suspect's face not visible
   - Weapon not clearly visible
   - Limited value for identification
   - Cannot establish sequence of events clearly

4. **Witness Evidence:**
   - Inconsistencies between witnesses (location of injury, exact sequence)
   - Complainant's addendum statement (may suggest uncertainty initially)
   - Independent witnesses have limited view
   - Staff member cannot identify suspect
   - No witness can provide clear identification

5. **Disclosure Failures:**
   - Multiple items outstanding
   - Delay in serving material
   - May contain exculpatory material
   - Prejudices defence

6. **PACE Breaches:**
   - Identification procedure fundamentally flawed
   - Delay in appropriate adult
   - Incomplete custody records
   - May render evidence inadmissible

7. **Alibi Evidence:**
   - Defendant has alibi (at home with mother)
   - Alibi witness available
   - No evidence placing defendant at scene (other than disputed identification)

8. **No Comment Interview:**
   - Defendant exercised right to silence
   - No admissions made
   - No incriminating statements
   - Prosecution cannot rely on silence as evidence of guilt (though may seek adverse inference)

9. **Time Delay:**
   - Defendant arrested 17 hours after incident
   - Opportunity to dispose of evidence
   - No immediate forensic link

10. **Scene Contamination:**
    - Busy public area
    - Multiple people present
    - Scene not immediately preserved
    - Risk of contamination

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**

The prosecution case is weak. It relies almost entirely on disputed identification evidence, supported by poor quality CCTV and inconsistent witness accounts. There is no forensic evidence linking the defendant to the scene. The identification procedure was fundamentally flawed. Disclosure failures prejudice the defence. The case has significant weaknesses and may not be sufficient to secure a conviction.

## ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AND MATERIAL

### PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS - DEFENDANT

**Daniel James Hughes - Previous Convictions:**

1. **15 June 2018 - Common Assault**
   - Leeds Magistrates' Court
   - Fined £200, compensation £100
   - Incident in pub, minor altercation

2. **22 March 2019 - Criminal Damage**
   - Leeds Magistrates' Court

   - Incident involving fight, defendant punched victim causing broken jaw
   - Defendant claimed self-defence, jury rejected

**Note:** Previous conviction for violence (section 20) may be admissible as bad character evidence, though defence will oppose admission. Previous convictions are relatively minor and do not establish pattern of knife crime or section 18 offences.

### INTELLIGENCE REPORTS

**Intelligence Report 1 - 24 November 2023:**
Intelligence suggests Daniel Hughes may be involved in incident at Golden Dragon Takeaway. Hughes known to frequent area. Previous involvement in violence. Intelligence source: Confidential.

**Intelligence Report 2 - 25 November 2023:**
Further intelligence regarding Hughes' associates and known locations. Some information redacted for operational security.

**DEFENCE POSITION:**
Intelligence reports are of limited value. They do not provide direct evidence of involvement. Some information is redacted, limiting their usefulness. Defence will challenge admission if prosecution seeks to rely on them.

### SCENE EXAMINATION REPORT

**Scene:** Golden Dragon Takeaway, 89 Kirkstall Road, Leeds  
**Examination Date:** 24 November 2023, 01:00 - 04:00 hours  
**Examiner:** SOCO Martin Taylor

**Findings:**
- Blood samples taken from floor (confirmed as Marcus Johnson's)
- No weapon recovered
- No other significant forensic findings
- Scene was busy public area, limited forensic opportunities
- Some areas not examined due to business needing to reopen

**Limitations:**

## EXPERT EVIDENCE

### MEDICAL EXPERT - PROSECUTION

**Expert:** Dr. Amanda Roberts, Consultant Forensic Pathologist  
**Report Date:** 15 December 2023

**Opinion:**
The injury sustained by Marcus Johnson is consistent with a deliberate stabbing with a sharp-bladed instrument, such as a knife. The location of the injury (lower left abdomen), the depth of penetration, and the nature of the damage (full thickness bowel laceration) are consistent with significant force being applied with intent to cause serious harm.

The injury is not consistent with an accidental injury or a minor altercation. The force required to cause such an injury suggests deliberate intent.

**DEFENCE POSITION:**
The defence does not dispute that a serious injury was caused. However, the defence will contend that:
1. The medical evidence does not establish who caused the injury
2. The medical evidence does not establish intent (force could be consistent with recklessness rather than intent)
3. The injury could theoretically have been caused accidentally in a struggle, though this is less likely

### FORENSIC EXPERT - DEFENCE

**Expert:** Dr. James Wilson, Forensic Scientist  
**Report Date:** 10 February 2024

**Opinion:**
The complete absence of forensic evidence linking the defendant to the scene or the complainant is highly significant. In a stabbing incident, one would typically expect to find:
- Blood on the perpetrator's clothing
- DNA transfer between perpetrator and victim
- Fingerprints at the scene
- Recovery of the weapon

The absence of all of these factors raises serious questions about whether the defendant was involved. While it is possible that the defendant changed clothing or that forensic transfer did not occur, the complete absence of any forensic link is unusual and may support the defence case.

**PROSECUTION POSITION:**
The prosecution will contend that the absence of forensic evidence is not exculpatory. The defendant had 17 hours to dispose of evidence. He may have changed clothing. DNA transfer may not have occurred. The absence of evidence does not prove absence of involvement.

## CASE MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTIONS

### CASE MANAGEMENT HEARING - 15 December 2023

## FINAL CASE SUMMARY

This is a section 18 OAPA 1861 case involving an alleged stabbing at a takeaway in Leeds. The prosecution case relies heavily on identification evidence, which is disputed. The identification procedure was flawed, CCTV is of poor quality, and there is no forensic evidence linking the defendant to the scene. The defendant has an alibi and maintains his innocence. There are significant disclosure failures and PACE compliance issues. The case has substantial weaknesses and the outcome is uncertain.

**Key Strengths for Prosecution:**
- Complainant identifies defendant
- Independent witnesses confirm incident occurred
- Serious injury consistent with stabbing
- Defendant has previous conviction for violence

**Key Strengths for Defence:**
- Flawed identification procedure
- No forensic evidence
- Poor quality CCTV
- Alibi evidence
- Disclosure failures
- PACE breaches
- Inconsistent witness accounts

**Likely Issues at Trial:**
- Admissibility of identification evidence
- Reliability of identification
- Significance of absence of forensic evidence
- Disclosure failures and their impact
- PACE compliance
- Alibi evidence
- Whether case should proceed or be stayed

**Estimated Outcome:**
Uncertain. Case has significant weaknesses but prosecution will proceed. Outcome will depend on admissibility of identification evidence and strength of alibi. Defence has strong arguments for acquittal or stay of proceedings.
