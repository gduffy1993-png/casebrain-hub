# Prosecution Case Summary (Fictional)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411 | **Defendant:** Jordan Clarke

## Summary of Allegation
On 12 August 2024 at approximately 23:48, outside the Blue Lantern takeaway/taxi rank, the defendant Jordan Clarke is alleged to have wounded Daniel Foster with a folding knife, causing a serious laceration to the left flank. The prosecution case is that this was done with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (s18 OAPA 1861).

## Prosecution Narrative
The incident occurred during a brief altercation outside the takeaway. The complainant Daniel Foster was waiting in the taxi rank queue when he became involved in a verbal exchange with a male wearing a dark hooded top. The exchange escalated quickly, and the male produced a knife and struck the complainant once to the left side, causing a deep laceration. The incident lasted approximately 15-30 seconds before the attacker fled. The complainant was taken to hospital and required sutures.

## Evidence Relied Upon
1. **Witness Statements:** Complainant (Daniel Foster), eyewitness (Aisha Patel), door staff (Kevin Morris)
2. **CCTV:** Partial coverage from takeaway and nearby pub cameras; quality varies; some angles obscured
3. **Medical Evidence:** Hospital records showing laceration requiring sutures; mechanism consistent with sharp implement
4. **Forensic Evidence:** Folding knife recovered nearby; partial DNA trace (mixed profile, not exclusive to defendant)
5. **Identification:** Witnesses identify defendant from CCTV stills and description; lighting/angle conditions noted
6. **Interview:** Defendant gave no comment interview; solicitor present throughout

## Prosecution Position on Intent
The prosecution asserts that the use of a knife in the circumstances, combined with the nature of the injury and the context of the altercation, demonstrates specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The prosecution will invite the court to infer intent from the weapon used and the location/strike.

## Disclosure Position
MG6C schedule provided 17 August 2024 (incomplete; some items pending). CCTV continuity documentation being finalised. Full unused material review ongoing.
