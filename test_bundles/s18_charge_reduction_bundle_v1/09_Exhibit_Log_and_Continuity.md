- **Recovered:** 13 August 2024, 03:30, from street near Blue Lantern takeaway
- **Recovered by:** SOCO Officer James Wright
- **Initial handling:** Placed in evidence bag, sealed, logged
- **Gap noted:** Between recovery (03:30) and formal lab intake (14 August 2024, 10:00), the exhibit was stored in station property store. Documentation shows the property store log entry, but there is a 2-hour window (13 August 14:00-16:00) where the exhibit's exact location within the property store is not specifically documented in the continuity log. This is being clarified.

## Continuity Issues Requiring Clarification
1. **EXH/001 (Knife):** 2-hour window in property store (13 August 14:00-16:00) requires formal log completion
2. **EXH/002, EXH/003, EXH/004 (CCTV):** Gap between download and formal exhibit logging (2-3 hours) documented in officer statement but requires formal continuity log entry
3. **CCTV Export Format:** Technical details of export process and format conversion require documentation
