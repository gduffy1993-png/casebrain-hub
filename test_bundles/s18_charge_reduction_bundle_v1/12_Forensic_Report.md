# Forensic Report (Fictional)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
**Exhibit:** EXH/001 (Folding Knife)  
**Report Date:** 20 August 2024  
**Examiner:** Dr Sarah Mitchell, Forensic Science Laboratory

## Examination Summary
A folding knife was submitted for forensic examination. The knife was recovered from the street near the Blue Lantern takeaway on 13 August 2024.

## Findings

### DNA Analysis
- **Result:** Partial DNA profile obtained from handle area
- **Profile type:** Mixed profile (multiple contributors)
- **Defendant's DNA:** Present in mixed profile but not exclusive
- **Limitations:** Profile is partial; multiple contributors; cannot definitively attribute all DNA to defendant; secondary transfer possible

### Trace Evidence
- **Blood:** Traces of blood found on blade; insufficient for full DNA profile
- **Other:** No other significant trace evidence

### Weapon Description
- **Type:** Folding knife, blade length approximately 8cm
- **Condition:** Used; some wear; no obvious distinguishing marks

## Conclusions
The knife shows evidence of use and contains a mixed DNA profile that includes the defendant's DNA. However, the profile is partial and contains multiple contributors, meaning it cannot be definitively stated that the defendant was the sole or primary handler of the weapon. Secondary transfer of DNA is possible.

The presence of blood traces on the blade is consistent with the weapon being used to cause injury, but the limited profile prevents definitive attribution.

## Limitations
1. Mixed DNA profile (multiple contributors)
2. Partial profile (not complete)
3. Secondary transfer cannot be ruled out
4. Continuity gap between recovery and lab intake (see exhibit log) - does not affect DNA results but requires clarification
