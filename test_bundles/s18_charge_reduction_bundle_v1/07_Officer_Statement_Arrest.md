## Statement
I, PC Rachel Turner, make this statement of my own free will.

On 13 August 2024 at approximately 02:15, I attended an address at 12 Fiction Close, London AB1 2CD in connection with an investigation into a wounding that occurred on 12 August 2024.

I arrested Jordan Clarke (DOB: 14 March 1998) on suspicion of wounding with intent (s18 OAPA 1861). I cautioned him at the scene. He made no reply to the caution.

Mr Clarke was transported to the police station and booked into custody. He was offered his rights, including the right to legal advice, which he requested. A solicitor was arranged.

Mr Clarke was interviewed under caution on 13 August 2024 at 09:30. He gave a no comment interview throughout. His solicitor was present.

During the investigation, CCTV footage was obtained from the Blue Lantern takeaway and nearby premises. Witness statements were taken from the complainant Daniel Foster, eyewitness Aisha Patel, and door staff Kevin Morris.

A folding knife was recovered from the scene area on 13 August 2024 by Scene of Crime Officers. The knife was submitted for forensic examination.
