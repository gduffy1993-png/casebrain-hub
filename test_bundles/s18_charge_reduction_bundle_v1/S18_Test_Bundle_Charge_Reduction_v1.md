## 02 Charge Sheet (Fictional)
**Count 1:** Wounding with intent (s18 OAPA 1861).  
**Particulars:** On 12 Aug 2024 at the Blue Lantern takeaway/taxi rank, Jordan Clarke allegedly wounded Daniel Foster with a folding knife, intending to cause GBH.

- Medical mechanism consistent with single motion; does not prove specific intent.  
- Weapon recovered nearby; partial DNA (non-exclusive); continuity gap between recovery and lab intake.  
- Seeking s18 → s20 (or lesser) based on intent contestability.

---

---

## 11A Turnbull Identification Assessment (Supplemental)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
**Assessment Date:** 30 August 2024

### Identification Conditions Summary
- **Lighting:** Variable; streetlights and takeaway window lighting; areas of shadow; not optimal for facial identification.  
- **Distance:** Witnesses at 3–50 metres; door staff at ~50m; complainant at close range but brief exposure.  
- **Duration:** Incident visible for 15–30 seconds; identification window brief.  
- **Obstruction:** Attacker wore dark hooded top with hood up throughout; facial features not clearly visible in any CCTV still or witness account.  
- **Angle:** CCTV angles partial; signage and camera positioning limit facial visibility; back/side views primarily.  
- **Similarity:** Multiple individuals in area wearing similar dark clothing; no distinctive features reliably distinguishing attacker from others.

### Turnbull Risk Factors
1. **Poor viewing conditions:** Lighting variable, distance, brief duration.  
2. **Obstruction:** Hood worn throughout; no clear facial view.  
3. **Witness uncertainty:** All witnesses express uncertainty; CCTV stills show similarity but not certainty.  
4. **Similar clothing:** Other individuals in area wearing similar dark clothing.  
5. **No distinctive features:** No reliable distinguishing features visible in available evidence.

### CCTV Quality Assessment (Facial Identification)
- **Facial visibility:** Poor to non-existent across all cameras due to hood, angle, and lighting.  
- **Identification reliability:** CCTV footage is unreliable for positive identification purposes. Facial features are not clearly visible; identification would require inference from clothing and general build, which is insufficient for Turnbull compliance.  
- **Use of CCTV:** CCTV may assist with sequence/duration assessment but does not support reliable identification of the individual involved.

### Conclusion
Identification evidence presents Turnbull risk. Conditions were poor (lighting, distance, duration, obstruction). Witnesses express uncertainty. CCTV does not provide reliable facial identification. Defence will challenge identification reliability and seek Turnbull direction.

- Blood traces on blade; insufficient for full DNA.  
- Continuity gap noted between recovery and lab intake; does not affect DNA result but needs clarification.

---

## 13 Medical Report
- Laceration left flank ~8cm; penetrated muscle, no organ damage; sutured (12 stitches).  
- Mechanism: single sharp-force trauma; consistent with single motion; injury does not show multiple strikes or sustained attack.  
- Mechanism alone cannot determine intent.

---

---

## 17 MG6C Unused Material Schedule (Incomplete)
- Phone data (pending), additional CCTV (pending), clothing forensics (pending), PNB entries (partial), medical records (not obtained). Defence requests completion, forensic and phone disclosure, full continuity.

---

## 18 Disclosure Correspondence (Highlights)
- Defence (20 Aug): requests complete MG6C, CCTV continuity, phone data clarity, full forensic methodology/chain, medical mechanism clarification, timetable.  
- CPS (25 Aug): acknowledges; working to complete by 01 Sep; continuity and phone reliance pending.  
- Defence follow-up (28 Aug): presses for completion by PTPH (04 Sep); will seek directions if not met.

---

## 19 Defence Review & Strategy
- **Primary Strategy:** Fight Charge (Trial Strategy) — challenge identification reliability under Turnbull; if identification fails, case collapses. Charge reduction (s18 → s20) remains fallback if identification is admitted but intent is contestable.  
- **Pressure Points:** Turnbull ID risk (lighting/hood/duration/uncertainty); CCTV quality insufficient for facial ID; medical single-motion ambiguity; brief duration (15–30s); partial/non-exclusive DNA; incomplete MG6C; continuity gaps (CCTV/weapon); phone data pending.  
- **Win Conditions (Fight Charge):** Identification successfully challenged/excluded under Turnbull; prosecution case collapses; OR identification admitted but intent not proven beyond reasonable doubt; medical supports single/brief blow; CCTV shows no sustained/targeted conduct; weapon use lacks targeting/duration.  
- **Win Conditions (Charge Reduction Fallback):** If identification admitted, then: no s18 intent articulated beyond reasonable doubt; medical supports single/brief blow; CCTV shows no sustained/targeted conduct; weapon use lacks targeting/duration; court accepts proportional downgrade.  
- **Loss Conditions:** Identification admitted and reliable; prosecution shows sustained/targeted conduct; medical supports repeated/targeted blows; CCTV shows prolonged attack; weapon use shows targeting/duration; court rejects challenges.  
- **Procedural Actions:** Request Turnbull direction; challenge CCTV quality for identification; chase disclosure with timetable; seek directions if missed; full CCTV export + continuity; complete MG6C; forensic methodology + chain; medical mechanism clarification; phone/message disclosure.

---

## 20 Defence Case Statement
- **Primary Issue:** Identification reliability — Turnbull risk. Conditions were poor (lighting variable, distance, brief duration ~15–30s, hood obstruction throughout, witness uncertainty, similar clothing on others, CCTV quality insufficient for facial identification). Defence will challenge identification and seek Turnbull direction. If identification is unreliable or excluded, case fails.  
- **Secondary Issues:** If identification admitted, then intent threshold (s18 vs s20), sequence/duration (brief), forensic weight (partial mixed DNA), disclosure completeness.  
- **Position:** Identification is unreliable and should be excluded or heavily qualified under Turnbull. If identification is admitted, harm accepted but intent not at s18 threshold; circumstances support s20/lesser; seek charge review/downgrade as fallback.

---

## 21 PTPH Case Management Note
- PTPH 04 Sep 2024: Plea Not Guilty to s18. Defence primary position: identification unreliable (Turnbull challenge). Fallback: contests intent; seeks reduction to s20 if identification admitted.  
- Disclosure outstanding: MG6C incomplete; CCTV continuity; phone data; forensic methodology; full CCTV quality assessment for identification purposes.  
- Directions requested: Turnbull direction on identification; completion by 15 Sep; charge review; possible defence medical expert; trial window after disclosure.

---

## 22 Bail Conditions Summary
- Bailed 13 Aug; conditions: no contact with complainant; exclusion zone around Blue Lantern; reside at 12 Fiction Close; surrender passport; attend court; no further offences.  
- Bail continued at PTPH; no breaches reported.

---

## 23 Draft Skeleton Argument – Charge Reduction
- Framework: s18 requires specific intent; s20 does not.  
- Submissions: brief/chaotic 15–30s; no sustained/targeted conduct; medical single-motion ambiguity; weapon presence alone not intent; partial DNA non-exclusive; ID poor.  
- Proportional case management: invite s18 → s20; not a concession; reflects evidential intent contestability.
