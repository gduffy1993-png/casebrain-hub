# PTPH Case Management Note (Fictional)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
**Defendant:** Jordan Clarke  
**Court:** Fictional Crown Court for Testing  
**Date:** 04 September 2024

## Hearing Summary
Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing (PTPH) held on 04 September 2024.

## Plea
**Not Guilty** to s18 OAPA 1861. Defence primary position: identification unreliable (Turnbull challenge). Fallback: intent will be contested.

## Defence Position
**Primary:** Defence challenges identification reliability under Turnbull guidelines. Conditions were poor (lighting, distance, duration, obstruction, witness uncertainty, CCTV quality insufficient for facial identification). Defence seeks Turnbull direction.

**Fallback (if identification admitted):** Defence seeks charge reduction from s18 to s20 based on:
- Brief/chaotic incident (15-30 seconds)
- Medical mechanism consistent with single motion
- No evidence of sustained/targeted conduct
- Intent contestability

## Disclosure Status
- **MG6C Schedule:** Incomplete; outstanding items
- **CCTV Continuity:** Documentation being finalised
- **Phone Data:** Under review; reliance to be confirmed
- **Forensic Disclosure:** Full methodology pending

## Defence Requests
1. Completed MG6C schedule by 15 September 2024
2. Full CCTV continuity documentation
3. Confirmation on phone data reliance
4. Complete forensic disclosure
5. Medical mechanism clarification

## Case Management Directions
1. **Turnbull Direction:** Court to consider identification reliability; direction to be given if identification admitted
2. **Disclosure Deadline:** 15 September 2024 for outstanding items
3. **Defence Case Statement:** Served (01 September 2024)
4. **Expert Evidence:** Defence may seek medical expert on mechanism (if identification admitted)
5. **Trial Window:** To be confirmed following disclosure completion
6. **Charge Review:** Prosecution to review charge in light of defence case statement (if identification admitted)

## Next Steps
1. Prosecution to complete disclosure by 15 September 2024
2. Defence to consider expert evidence
3. Parties to liaise on charge position
4. Case to be listed for further case management if required

## Issues for Trial
1. **Primary:** Identification reliability (Turnbull) — if identification fails, case collapses
2. **Fallback (if identification admitted):** Intent threshold (s18 vs s20)
3. **Fallback (if identification admitted):** Sequence/duration of incident
4. **Fallback (if identification admitted):** Forensic evidence weight
5. Disclosure completeness
