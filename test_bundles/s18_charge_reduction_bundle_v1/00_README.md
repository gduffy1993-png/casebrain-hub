## Upload checklist for CaseBrain
1) Upload PDF: `S18_Test_Bundle_Charge_Reduction_v1.pdf` (generated from these markdowns).  
2) Ensure the following extract:
   - Charges: s18 OAPA 1861 (alleged), proposed reduction to s20.  
   - Dates: Incident 12 Aug 2024, arrest 13 Aug 2024, interview 13 Aug 2024.  
   - Evidence map: CCTV (partial/angle), weapon (knife), medical (single laceration), statements (complainant, eyewitness, door staff), forensic (partial DNA, not exclusive), MG6C gaps, continuity gaps.  
   - Disclosure gaps: incomplete MG6C, CCTV continuity/download gap, late/partial unused schedule, missing phone data notes, missing full CCTV export.  
3) Phase 2 expectations:
   - Strategy Commitment → Charge Reduction (s18 → s20) with directive plan.  
   - Win/Loss/Outcome range reflecting intent contestability (sequence/duration/targeting).  
   - Procedural actions: chase MG6C completion, CCTV continuity, phone/message disclosure, clarify weapon handling gaps.

## How to generate the PDF (local)
Compile all markdown files (01–24) into a single PDF named `S18_Test_Bundle_Charge_Reduction_v1.pdf`, ensuring header on every page: “FICTIONAL TEST BUNDLE — NOT FOR REAL WORLD USE” and footer watermark “Training/Test Document”.

## Notes
- All names, addresses, phone numbers are fictional placeholders (07xxx, AB1 2CD).  
- Court name is fictional.  
- Bundle designed to be “winnable” via s18 → s20 reduction because intent is contestable.
