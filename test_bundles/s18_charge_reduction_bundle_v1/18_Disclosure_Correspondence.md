   - Complete chain of custody from source device to exhibit
   - Technical details of download/export process
   - Clarification of the gap between download and formal exhibit logging

   - If so, please provide full disclosure
   - If not, please confirm it will not be relied upon

4. **Forensic Disclosure** - Please provide:
   - Full forensic methodology for knife examination (EXH/001)

We look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully,
