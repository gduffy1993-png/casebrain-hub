## Statement
I, Aisha Patel, make this statement of my own free will. I understand that I may be required to give evidence in court.

On 12 August 2024, I was waiting in the taxi rank queue outside the Blue Lantern takeaway. It was around 23:48. I was near the front of the queue, maybe 3 or 4 people back.

I saw two men having an argument. One was a younger guy - I think that was Daniel, the one who got hurt. The other was wearing a dark hooded top with the hood up. I couldn't see his face because of the hood and the angle.

The argument got heated quickly. The man in the hood pulled something out - it looked like a knife - and there was a scuffle. It was all very fast, maybe 20 or 30 seconds from start to finish. The man in the hood ran off straight after.

I saw Daniel was hurt and bleeding. I helped him and someone called an ambulance.

I was shown CCTV stills by the police. The person in the stills looks like the person I saw, but I can't be completely certain because I didn't see the face clearly. The lighting wasn't great and it happened very quickly. There were also other people around wearing similar dark clothing.
