Training/Test Document

# Defence Review and Strategy (Fictional)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
**Defendant:** Jordan Clarke  
**Date:** 30 August 2024

## Strategy: Fight Charge (Trial Strategy) with Charge Reduction Fallback

### Primary Objective
**Fight Charge (Trial Strategy):** Challenge identification reliability under Turnbull guidelines. If identification is unreliable or excluded, case collapses. Target: identification challenge leading to acquittal or dismissal.

### Fallback Objective
**Charge Reduction (s18 → s20):** If identification is admitted, require prosecution to articulate intent theory early and aim for charge reduction from s18 to s20 or lesser offence. Defence accepts harm occurred but challenges that intent meets s18 threshold. Target: proportional downgrade under case management, not a concession.

## Pressure Points Identified

### 1. Identification (Turnbull Issues)
- **Weakness:** Poor lighting, partial angles, hoods obscuring faces
- **Evidence:** CCTV stills show limited facial visibility; witnesses express uncertainty
- **Pressure:** Request Turnbull direction; challenge identification reliability
- **Action:** Seek disclosure of lighting/angle documentation; request identification procedure safeguards

### 2. Medical Mechanism Ambiguity
- **Weakness:** Medical report states mechanism consistent with single motion; does not prove intent
- **Evidence:** Injury pattern supports brief incident rather than sustained attack
- **Pressure:** Medical evidence does not support s18 intent threshold
- **Action:** Request medical expert clarification on mechanism and intent implications

### 3. Incident Duration/Sequence
- **Weakness:** Incident lasted 15-30 seconds; chaotic, not prolonged
- **Evidence:** CCTV and witness statements support brief scuffle
- **Pressure:** Brief duration undermines sustained/targeted conduct required for s18
- **Action:** Emphasise sequence/duration evidence in submissions

### 4. Forensic Limitations
- **Weakness:** Partial DNA profile, mixed contributors, not exclusive
- **Evidence:** Forensic report states secondary transfer possible
- **Pressure:** Forensic evidence does not definitively link defendant to weapon use
- **Action:** Request full forensic methodology disclosure; challenge exclusivity

### 5. Disclosure Gaps
- **Weakness:** MG6C incomplete; CCTV continuity gaps; phone data pending
- **Evidence:** Disclosure correspondence shows outstanding items
- **Pressure:** Incomplete disclosure undermines trial readiness
- **Action:** Chase disclosure with timetable; seek directions if not complete

### 6. Continuity Issues
- **Weakness:** CCTV and weapon continuity gaps documented
- **Evidence:** Exhibit log shows gaps between recovery/download and formal logging
- **Pressure:** Continuity gaps may affect admissibility/weight
- **Action:** Request full continuity documentation; clarify gaps

## Win Conditions (Fight Charge — Primary)
1. Identification successfully challenged/excluded under Turnbull; prosecution case collapses
2. OR identification admitted but unreliable; court applies Turnbull warnings; identification heavily qualified
3. OR identification admitted but intent not proven beyond reasonable doubt; medical supports single/brief blow; CCTV shows no sustained/targeted conduct; weapon use lacks targeting/duration

## Win Conditions (Charge Reduction — Fallback)
1. If identification admitted: prosecution cannot articulate s18 intent beyond reasonable doubt
2. Medical evidence shows mechanism consistent with single/brief blow (not sustained/targeted)
3. CCTV/sequence evidence shows no prolonged or targeted conduct
4. Weapon use lacks duration/targeting to prove specific intent
5. Court accepts proportional downgrade (s18 → s20) under case management

## Loss Conditions
1. Identification admitted and found reliable; prosecution case proceeds
2. Prosecution maintains s18 and evidences specific intent with sustained/targeted conduct
3. Medical evidence shows injuries consistent with repeated/targeted blows
4. CCTV/sequence evidence shows prolonged or deliberate attack
5. Weapon use demonstrates targeting/duration supporting intent
6. Court rejects identification challenge and declines proportional downgrade

## Priority Evidence (Fight Charge)
1. **Identification conditions:** Lighting, distance, duration, obstruction (hood), witness uncertainty, CCTV quality, similar clothing
2. **CCTV quality assessment:** Facial identification reliability, visibility, angle limitations
3. **Witness identification:** Viewing conditions, certainty levels, first accounts

## Priority Evidence (Charge Reduction Fallback)
1. Medical evidence: injury severity (non-determinative) and mechanism (determinative for intent)
2. Sequence/duration evidence from CCTV or witnesses (brief vs sustained conduct)
3. Weapon recovery and manner of use (duration, targeting, escalation)
4. Defendant's actions before and after incident (planning vs reactive)

## Procedural Actions
1. **Request Turnbull direction** on identification reliability
2. **Challenge CCTV quality** for identification purposes; request quality assessment
3. Chase outstanding disclosure with clear timetable as proportional case management and record responses
4. Document missing items and seek directions if timetable slips (stay/abuse only if failures persist after clear chase trail and directions/timetable)
5. Request full CCTV export with continuity from source device to exhibit
6. Request completed MG6C/unused schedule; note missing/late items
7. Request forensic methodology and chain of custody for weapon; clarify handling gap
8. Request medical mechanism clarification (single vs sustained action)
