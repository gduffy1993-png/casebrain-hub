# Turnbull Identification Assessment (Supplemental)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
**Defendant:** Jordan Clarke  
**Assessment Date:** 30 August 2024

## Identification Conditions Summary

### Lighting
- Variable; streetlights and takeaway window lighting
- Areas of shadow
- Not optimal for facial identification

### Distance
- Witnesses at 3–50 metres
- Door staff at ~50m
- Complainant at close range but brief exposure

### Duration
- Incident visible for 15–30 seconds
- Identification window brief

### Obstruction
- Attacker wore dark hooded top with hood up throughout
- Facial features not clearly visible in any CCTV still or witness account

### Angle
- CCTV angles partial
- Signage and camera positioning limit facial visibility
- Back/side views primarily

### Similarity
- Multiple individuals in area wearing similar dark clothing
- No distinctive features reliably distinguishing attacker from others

## Turnbull Risk Factors

1. **Poor viewing conditions:** Lighting variable, distance, brief duration
2. **Obstruction:** Hood worn throughout; no clear facial view
3. **Witness uncertainty:** All witnesses express uncertainty; CCTV stills show similarity but not certainty
4. **Similar clothing:** Other individuals in area wearing similar dark clothing
5. **No distinctive features:** No reliable distinguishing features visible in available evidence

## CCTV Quality Assessment (Facial Identification)

### Facial Visibility
- Poor to non-existent across all cameras due to hood, angle, and lighting

### Identification Reliability
- CCTV footage is unreliable for positive identification purposes
- Facial features are not clearly visible
- Identification would require inference from clothing and general build, which is insufficient for Turnbull compliance

### Use of CCTV
- CCTV may assist with sequence/duration assessment but does not support reliable identification of the individual involved

## Conclusion

Identification evidence presents Turnbull risk. Conditions were poor (lighting, distance, duration, obstruction). Witnesses express uncertainty. CCTV does not provide reliable facial identification. Defence will challenge identification reliability and seek Turnbull direction.
