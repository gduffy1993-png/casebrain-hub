Training/Test Document

# Charge Sheet (Fictional)
- **Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742  
- **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
- **Defendant:** Jordan Clarke  
- **Court:** Fictional Crown Court for Testing  

## Allegation
**Count 1:** Wounding with intent (s18 Offences Against the Person Act 1861)  
**Particulars:** On 12 August 2024 at the Blue Lantern takeaway/taxi rank, Jordan Clarke is alleged to have unlawfully and maliciously wounded Daniel Foster with a folding knife, intending to cause grievous bodily harm.

## Proposed Defence Position
- Intent contested; incident brief and chaotic (15–30 seconds).  
- Identification conditions poor (lighting/angle/partial hood; similar clothing).  
- Medical mechanism consistent with single motion; does not prove specific intent.  
- Weapon recovered nearby; partial DNA trace (non-exclusive); continuity gap between street recovery and lab intake.  
- Proportional reduction sought: s18 → s20 (or alternative lesser) based on intent contestability.
