# Officer Statement (CCTV Seizure)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
**Officer:** DC Imran Shah, Badge: 67890  
**Statement Date:** 14 August 2024

## Statement
I, DC Imran Shah, make this statement of my own free will.

On 13 August 2024, I attended the Blue Lantern takeaway and nearby premises to secure CCTV footage in connection with the investigation into the wounding of Daniel Foster on 12 August 2024.

I obtained CCTV footage from:
1. Blue Lantern takeaway - external camera covering the taxi rank area
2. Red Lion pub - external camera covering part of the street
3. High Street general view camera (council-operated)

The footage was downloaded to a USB device on 13 August 2024. The download process was documented, but there was a brief period (approximately 2 hours) between the initial download and the formal exhibit logging where the USB device was in my possession but not yet logged into the exhibit system. This was due to operational demands and the need to secure multiple camera feeds.

The footage was later exported and logged as exhibits. The quality of the footage varies - some cameras have better lighting and angles than others. The takeaway camera has a partial view of the incident area, but the angle means the faces of those involved are not always clearly visible, particularly when hoods are worn.

Timecodes on the footage show the incident occurring at approximately 23:48:12 on 12 August 2024. The incident appears to last approximately 15-30 seconds based on the footage.

CCTV stills were extracted and shown to witnesses for identification purposes. The stills show a male in dark clothing with a hood, but facial features are not always clear due to lighting and angle.

**Note:** Full continuity documentation for the CCTV download and export process is being finalised. Some technical details regarding the export format and chain of custody between download and exhibit logging require clarification.
