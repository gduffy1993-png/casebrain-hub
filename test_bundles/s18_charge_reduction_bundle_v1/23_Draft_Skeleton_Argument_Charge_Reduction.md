# Draft Skeleton Argument: Identification Challenge & Charge Reduction (Fictional)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
**Defendant:** Jordan Clarke  
**Date:** 05 September 2024

## Introduction
This skeleton sets out the defence position on identification reliability (Turnbull challenge) and, if identification is admitted, charge reduction from s18 OAPA 1861 (wounding with intent) to s20 OAPA 1861 (unlawful wounding) or alternative lesser offence.

## Legal Framework
- **s18 OAPA 1861:** Requires specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm
- **s20 OAPA 1861:** Unlawful wounding without specific intent requirement
- **Case Law:** Intent must be proved beyond reasonable doubt; brief/chaotic incidents may not support s18

## Defence Submissions

### 1. Intent Threshold Not Met
The prosecution must prove specific intent to cause GBH. The evidence does not support this:
- Incident was brief (15-30 seconds) and chaotic
- No evidence of planning or premeditation
- No evidence of sustained or targeted conduct
- Medical mechanism consistent with single motion, not sustained attack

### 3. Medical Evidence (Fallback — if identification admitted)
The medical report states:
- Injury mechanism consistent with single sharp force trauma
- Mechanism could be consistent with either deliberate single strike or single motion during brief/chaotic altercation
- Injury does not show evidence of multiple strikes or sustained attack
- Intent cannot be determined from medical evidence alone

The medical evidence does not support the s18 intent threshold.

### 3. Sequence/Duration Evidence
- CCTV and witness evidence shows incident lasting 15-30 seconds
- No evidence of prolonged or targeted conduct
- Circumstances support brief/chaotic altercation rather than sustained attack
- Sequence does not support specific intent inference

### 5. Weapon Use (Fallback — if identification admitted)
- Weapon recovered nearby with partial DNA (mixed profile, not exclusive)
- No evidence of weapon use demonstrating targeting/duration
- Weapon presence alone does not establish s18 intent
- Weight depends on manner, duration, targeting - all absent here

## Proportional Case Management
**Primary route:** Identification challenge under Turnbull. If identification is excluded or heavily qualified, case fails.

**Fallback route (if identification admitted):** The defence invites the court to consider:
- Proportional charge reduction under case management
- s18 → s20 reduction reflects the evidence available
- Reduction is not a concession but reflects intent contestability
- Early charge review promotes efficient case management

## Conclusion
The defence submits that:
1. **Primary:** Identification is unreliable under Turnbull and should be excluded or heavily qualified. If identification fails, case collapses.
2. **Fallback (if identification admitted):** The evidence does not support s18 intent threshold
3. **Fallback (if identification admitted):** The circumstances support s20 (unlawful wounding) or alternative lesser offence
4. **Fallback (if identification admitted):** Proportional charge reduction should be considered

The defence invites the court to apply Turnbull guidelines on identification. If identification is admitted, the defence invites the prosecution to consider charge reduction and, if not agreed, will seek a ruling from the court.
