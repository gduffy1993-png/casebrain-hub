## Statement
I, Daniel Foster, make this statement of my own free will. I understand that I may be required to give evidence in court.

On the evening of 12 August 2024, I was waiting in the taxi rank queue outside the Blue Lantern takeaway. It was around 23:48. The area was lit by streetlights and the takeaway's lights, but it was quite dark in places.

A male came up to me. He was wearing a dark hooded top with the hood up, so I couldn't see his face clearly. He started shouting at me about something - I'm not sure what exactly, it happened very fast. I told him to leave me alone.

The next thing I knew, he pulled something out - I think it was a knife - and lunged at me. I felt a sharp pain in my left side. It all happened in seconds, maybe 15 or 20 seconds from when he first approached. He ran off straight away.

I looked down and saw I was bleeding. A woman from the queue helped me and someone called an ambulance. I was taken to hospital and had to have stitches.

I didn't know the person who attacked me. I couldn't see his face properly because of the hood and the lighting. I remember he was wearing dark clothes - a dark hooded top and dark trousers or jeans.

I was shown some CCTV stills later by the police. They asked if I recognised anyone. I said the person in the stills looked similar to the person who attacked me, but I can't be 100% certain because I didn't see the face clearly at the time.
