## Statement
I, Kevin Morris, make this statement of my own free will. I understand that I may be required to give evidence in court.

I work as door staff at the Red Lion pub, which is about 50 metres from the Blue Lantern takeaway. On 12 August 2024, I was outside the pub having a cigarette break at around 23:48.

I heard raised voices from the direction of the taxi rank. I looked over and saw two men - one was wearing a dark hooded top with the hood up. They were arguing and it looked like it was getting physical.

I saw the man in the hood pull something out - it looked like a knife or something similar. There was a brief scuffle, maybe 15 or 20 seconds, then the man in the hood ran off. The other man was holding his side and looked hurt.

I didn't get a clear view of the face of the man in the hood because of the angle and the lighting. The streetlights don't reach that area very well. I remember he was wearing dark clothes - a dark hooded top and dark trousers.

I was shown CCTV stills by the police. The person in the stills could be the person I saw, but I can't be certain because I didn't see the face clearly. There were other people around wearing similar dark clothing.
