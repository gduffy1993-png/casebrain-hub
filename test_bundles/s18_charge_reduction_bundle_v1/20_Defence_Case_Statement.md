# Defence Case Statement (Fictional)
**Case Ref:** CRN-TEST-8742 | **URN:** URN-23-TEST-4411  
**Defendant:** Jordan Clarke  
**Date:** 01 September 2024

## Issues to be Tried

### 1. Identification (Primary Issue)
The defence will challenge the reliability of identification evidence under Turnbull guidelines. The identification conditions were poor:
- **Lighting:** Variable; streetlights and takeaway window lighting; areas of shadow; not optimal for facial identification
- **Distance:** Witnesses at 3–50 metres; complainant at close range but brief exposure (~15–30 seconds)
- **Duration:** Incident visible for 15–30 seconds; identification window brief
- **Obstruction:** Alleged attacker wore dark hooded top with hood up throughout; facial features not clearly visible in any CCTV still or witness account
- **Angle:** CCTV angles partial; signage and camera positioning limit facial visibility; back/side views primarily
- **Similarity:** Multiple individuals in area wearing similar dark clothing; no distinctive features reliably distinguishing attacker from others
- **CCTV Quality:** CCTV footage is unreliable for positive identification purposes; facial features not clearly visible; identification would require inference from clothing and general build, which is insufficient for Turnbull compliance
- **Witness Uncertainty:** All witnesses express uncertainty; CCTV stills show similarity but not certainty

The defence will invite the court to apply Turnbull guidelines and find that identification is not reliable. If identification is unreliable or excluded, the case fails. If identification is admitted but heavily qualified, the defence will proceed to challenge intent (see Issue 2).

### 2. Intent (s18 vs s20) — Fallback Issue
**If identification is admitted:** The defence accepts that harm occurred but contests that the intent threshold for s18 is met. The defence case is:
- The incident was brief (15-30 seconds) and chaotic
- The medical evidence shows a mechanism consistent with a single motion, not sustained/targeted conduct
- There is no evidence of planning or premeditation
- The weapon use lacks the duration/targeting required to prove specific intent
- The circumstances are consistent with s20 (unlawful wounding) rather than s18 (wounding with intent)

### 3. Sequence/Duration
The defence will invite the court to find that the incident was brief and chaotic, not prolonged or targeted. The evidence shows:
- Incident duration: 15-30 seconds
- No evidence of sustained attack
- No evidence of targeting or escalation
- Medical mechanism supports single motion

### 4. Forensic Evidence
The defence will challenge the weight of forensic evidence:
- DNA profile is partial and mixed (multiple contributors)
- Profile is not exclusive to defendant
- Secondary transfer cannot be ruled out
- Continuity gaps may affect admissibility/weight

### 5. Disclosure
The defence will seek clarification on:
- Incomplete MG6C schedule
- CCTV continuity gaps
- Phone data reliance (if any)
- Forensic methodology and chain of custody

## Defence Position
The defence does not accept the s18 charge. The defence position is that:
1. **Primary:** Identification is unreliable under Turnbull and should be excluded or heavily qualified. If identification fails, case collapses.
2. **Fallback:** If identification is admitted, intent does not meet s18 threshold
3. If identification is admitted, the circumstances support s20 (unlawful wounding) or alternative lesser offence
4. Proportional charge reduction should be considered under case management if identification is admitted

The defence will invite the court to apply Turnbull guidelines on identification. If identification is admitted, the defence will invite the prosecution to review the charge and consider reduction to s20 based on the evidence available.
