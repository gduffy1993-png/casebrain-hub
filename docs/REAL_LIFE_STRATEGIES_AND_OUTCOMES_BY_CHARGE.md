# Real-Life Defence Strategies & Possible Outcomes by Charge (England & Wales)

**Purpose:** Reference for Option 3 – what the app (and AI) should “know” per offence type. Drawn from CPS, Sentencing Council, statute, and practice. Expand as needed; use as the fixed lists for offence types and strategy angles.

**How to use:** For each charge we classify into one offence category below. Each category has (1) **defence strategies** used in real cases and (2) **possible outcomes**. We don’t need to code “every” charge – we support these categories and map unknown charges to “other” with generic strategies/outcomes.

---

## Possible outcomes (all charges)

These are the real-life end states of a criminal case. The app can suggest “likely outcome range” or “what to prepare for” based on strategy.

| 2 | Conviction (as charged) | Guilty of full charge; sentencing follows. |
| 3 | Conviction (lesser charge) | Guilty of a lesser offence (e.g. s18 → s20; robbery → theft). |
| 4 | Guilty plea (full charge) | Early or late plea to charge as laid. |
| 5 | Guilty plea (lesser charge) | Plea accepted to lesser offence (charge reduction). |
| 6 | Case dropped / discontinued | Prosecution withdraws or offers no evidence. |

## Summary for the app

- **Offence categories:** robbery, assault_oapa, theft, burglary, drugs, fraud, sexual, criminal_damage_arson, public_order, other.
- **Strategies:** Use the tables above as the fixed list per category. AI or rules pick from these (or map to “other”).
- **Outcomes:** Use the “Possible outcomes” section and the per-charge outcome lines. We don’t invent new outcomes; we suggest from this set.
- **Expansion:** Add new offence categories (e.g. driving, harassment) by adding a new section with real defences/outcomes from CPS/Sentencing Council/statute. Aim for 10–20 strategies per category where sources support it; “other” covers the rest.

**Sources (used to build this doc):** CPS prosecution guidance (theft, robbery, criminal damage, fraud, drugs, offences against the person); Sentencing Council guidelines (robbery, assault, arson, affray, drugs); legislation (Theft Act 1968, Fraud Act 2006, SOA 2003, CDA 1971, POA 1986, OAPA 1861); Gov.uk crime outcomes and CJS statistics; practice summaries (Stuart Miller, Sutton Defence, Kang & Co, Harewood Law, e-lawresources).
