## 🧮 The Math (Why It Makes Sense)

### Example: Solo Practitioner on Starter (£49/month)

**Scenario:** Handle 10 cases/month

**Time saved per case:** 5-10 hours (document extraction, timeline, risk analysis)
**Total time saved:** 50-100 hours/month
**Value at £50/hour:** £2,500-5,000/month
**Cost:** £49/month
**ROI:** 50-100x

**In plain English:** You save £2,500-5,000 worth of time, and it costs you £49. You're getting 50-100x return.

---

### Example: Firm on Pro (£99/month)

**Scenario:** Handle 20 cases/month

**Time saved per case:** 10-15 hours
**Total time saved:** 200-300 hours/month
**Value at £50/hour:** £10,000-15,000/month
**Cost:** £99/month
**ROI:** 100-150x

**In plain English:** You save £10,000-15,000 worth of time, and it costs you £99. You're getting 100-150x return.

---

## 🎯 Key Point

**The £500-750/week is VALUE (time saved), not cost.**

- **Cost:** £49-99/month (what you pay)
- **Value:** £250-750/week (time saved = money saved)
- **ROI:** 20-150x (you get way more value than you pay)

**One case win typically pays for 5-7 months of Pro subscription.**
