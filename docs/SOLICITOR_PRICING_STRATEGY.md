# CaseBrain Pricing Strategy for UK Solicitors

## 🎯 Value Proposition

**CaseBrain saves solicitors 10-15 hours per case** through AI automation. At £50/hour, that's **£500-750 value per case**. One case win pays for months of subscription.

## 💰 Pricing Tiers

### **Free Tier** - £0/month
**Purpose:** Let solicitors properly test the system with real cases

**Limits:**
